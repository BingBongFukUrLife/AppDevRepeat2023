# User Guide

This is a simple app for generating recipes using OpenAI's chat API.

There are three tabs which are accessible with the general navbar:

- Browse
- Favorites
- Settings

You may infinitely scroll* in the browse page, upon scrolling more recipes will be generated below. Each recipe has a favorite button and is as unique as the AI generating is. It has been instructed to pose as a michelin star chef providing the best recipes it can.

The favorites button is toggalable on both the Browse page and Favorites page, and indicates with a filled or not filled in star. It is a simple 'yes it shows up in favorites' or not. These are stored locally.

The settings page featues an option to clear all favorites.

NOTE: The OpenAI key is stored locally, which is unsafe but this is a project and the key will be deleted after grading.
